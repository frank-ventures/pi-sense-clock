# pi-sense-clock

This code, when run on your Pi with a Sense HAT, displays the time with a couple of blinking lines in the empty spaces.

It's not power efficient, as it runs and updates every second.

You could remove the 'seconds' display, and run a cronjob to run the script every minute instead ðŸ¤·
